Local development
=================

The development workflow works best by pre-installing python dependencies with
``pip`` (or alternatives):

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn scikit-build-core nanobind setuptools_scm

Building the package requires a C++ 23 compiler with OpenMP support. The OpenMP
version must support user-defined reductions. Selecting the proper OpenMP
version requires some additional configuration, see below. Assuming the compiler
and OpenMP are present, the package can be compiled and installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -ve .

To change the build type, add ``-C cmake.build-type=Debug`` or
``-C cmake.build-type=Release`` to the command.

``scikit-build-core`` also experimentally supports editable installs (see
`their documentation <https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/index.html#editable-installs>`_):

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -C editable.rebuild=true -ve .

Linux
-----

It may be necessary to tell cmake which compiler it should use. For example,
using ``g++-14`` when that is not the system default can be done by adding a
``-C cmake.args="-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-14"`` option. The ``-C cmake.args=...``
option does not have to be repeated on rebuilds.

MacOS
-----

MacOS requires installing OpenMP using homebrew:

.. code-block:: bash

  brew install libomp

Also update the ``~/.zshrc`` config file with:

.. code-block:: bash

  export OpenMP_ROOT=$(brew --prefix)/opt/libomp

Windows
-------

The default MSVC C++ compiler on windows does not support a recent enough
OpenMP. In addition, the default powershell terminal on windows is not
configured for cmake to find the correct OpenMP version. Instead, use a
developer powershell configured for a 64-bit target architecture. To open such a
terminal, run the following code in a normal Powershell terminal:

.. code-block:: powershell

  $vswhere = "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}/Microsoft Visual Studio/Installer/vswhere.exe"
  $iloc = & $vswhere -products * -latest -property installationpath
  $devddl = "$iloc/Common7/Tools/Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll"
  Import-Module $devddl; Enter-VsDevShell -Arch amd64 -VsInstallPath $iloc -SkipAutomaticLocation

In addition, select the MSVC Clang compiler using ``-C cmake.args="-T ClangCL"``
the first time the package is installed:

.. code-block:: powershell

  pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -C cmake.args="-T ClangCL" -ve .

The ``-C cmake.args=...`` option does not have to be repeated on rebuilds.

You may need to install the [visual studio build
tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
with the optional Clang compiler support enabled.
