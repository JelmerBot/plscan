# Persistent Leaf Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise

This library provides a new clustering algorithm based on HDBSCAN. The primary
advantages of PLSCAN over the standard ``hdbscan`` library are:

 - PLSCAN automatically finds the optimal minimum cluster size.
 - PLSCAN can easily use all available cores to speed up computation;
 - PLSCAN has much faster implementations of tree condensing and cluster extraction;
 - PLSCAN does not rely on JIT compilation.

When using PLSCAN, only the `min_samples` parameter has to be given, which
specifies the number of neighbors used for mutual reachability distances. Higher
values produce smoother density profiles with fewer leaf clusters.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from plscan import PLSCAN

data = np.load("docs/data/data.npy")

clusterer = PLSCAN(
  min_samples = 5, # same as in HDBSCAN
).fit(data)

plt.figure()
plt.scatter(
  *data.T, c=clusterer.labels_ % 10, s=5, alpha=0.5, 
  edgecolor="none", cmap="tab10", vmin=0, vmax=9
)
plt.axis("off")
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0, right=1, top=1, bottom=0)
plt.show()
```

The algorithm builds a hierarchy of leaf-clusters, showing which clusters are
leaves as the minimum cluster size varies (filtration). Then, it computes the
total leaf-cluster persistence per minimum cluster size, and picks the minimum
cluster size that maximizes that score. The leaf-cluster hierarchy in
`leaf_tree_` can be plotted as an alternative to HDBSCAN\*'s condensed cluster
tree.

```python
clusterer.leaf_tree_.plot(leaf_separation=0.1)
plt.show()
```

Cluster segmentations for other high-persistence minimum cluster sizes can
be computed using the `cluster_layers` method. This method finds the
persistence peaks and returns their cluster labels and memberships.

```python
layers = clusterer.cluster_layers(n_peaks=4)
for i, (size, labels, probs) in enumerate(layers):
  plt.subplot(2, 2, i + 1)
  plt.scatter(
    *data.T,
    c=labels % 10,
    alpha=np.maximum(0.1, probs),
    s=1,
    linewidth=0,
    cmap="tab10",
  )
  plt.title(f"min_cluster_size={int(size)}")
  plt.axis("off")
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0, right=1, top=1, bottom=0)
plt.show()
```

## Local development

The development workflow works best by pre-installing python dependencies with
`pip` (or alternatives):

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn scikit-build-core nanobind setuptools_scm
```

Building the package requires a C++ 20 compiler with OpenMP support. The OpenMP
version must support user-defined reductions. Selecting the proper OpenMP
version requires some additional configuration, see below. Assuming the compiler
and OpenMP are present, the package can be compiled and installed with:

```bash
pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -ve .
```

To change the build type, add `-C cmake.build-type=Debug` or `-C
cmake.build-type=Release` to the command.

`scikit-build-core` also experimentally editable installs (see [their
documentation](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/index.html#editable-installs)):

```bash
pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -C editable.rebuild=true -ve .
```

### Linux

It may be necessary to tell cmake which compiler it should use. For example,
using `g++-14` when that is not the system default can be done by adding a `-C
cmake.args="-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-14"` option. The `-C cmake.args=...` option
does not have to be repeated on rebuilds.

### MacOS

MacOS requires installing OpenMP using homebrew:

```bash
brew install libomp
```

Also update the `~/.zshrc` config file with:

```bash
export OpenMP_ROOT=$(brew --prefix)/opt/libomp
```

### Windows

The default MSVC C++ compiler on windows does not support a recent enough
OpenMP. In addition, the default powershell terminal on windows is not
configured for cmake to find the correct OpenMP version. Instead, use a
developer powershell configured for a 64-bit target architecture. To open such a
terminal, run the following code in a normal Powershell terminal:

```powershell
$vswhere = "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}/Microsoft Visual Studio/Installer/vswhere.exe"
$iloc = & $vswhere -products * -latest -property installationpath
$devddl = "$iloc/Common7/Tools/Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll"
Import-Module $devddl; Enter-VsDevShell -Arch amd64 -VsInstallPath $iloc -SkipAutomaticLocation
```

In addition, select the MSVC Clang compiler using `-C cmake.args="-T
ClangCL"` the first time the package is installed:

```powershell
pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -C cmake.args="-T ClangCL" -ve . 
```

The `-C cmake.args=...` option does not have to be repeated on rebuilds.
